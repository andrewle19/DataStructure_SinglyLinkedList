# Data Structure Singly Linked List

This is a Project for a Data Structures class that implement a Singly Linked List.
The list stores a story(name, description), the team assigned to that story, the priority
of that story, and if the story was completed by the team. The Project includes standard
functions for a Singly Linked List such as Insert, Search, Remove and others. For more information
